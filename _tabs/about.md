Hello! I'm Amith, a software engineer passionate about building scalable and innovative solutions. I like solving complex challenges and enjoy sharing my technical journey through this blog. 

This blog is an attempt to solidify my learnings by documenting it and sharing it with you all.

Check out - [The Feynman Technique](https://aliabdaal.com/studying/the-feynman-technique/#:~:text=The%20Feynman%20technique%20is%20based,Like%20a%20small%20child.)

## Expertise

I specialize in:
- **System Design & Architecture:** High/low-level design of scalable, resilient distributed systems
- **Backend:** Python, Django, C#, MS-SQL Server, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka
- **Frontend:** React.js, JavaScript, jQuery
- **Databases & Caching:** MS-SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, Milvus
- **Deployment & Cloud:** Git, Docker, Kubernetes (Rancher), CI/CD, AWS, GCP
- **Other:** OpenCV, TensorFlow, IoT, Arduino

## Experience

Over the years, I've led and contributed to projects that drive innovation and business transformation:

- **Scalable Systems:** Engineered a distributed caching system using Redis Sentinels, Docker, and RabbitMQ. Designed a distributed build management and task scheduling system for an EDA tool.

- **Automation & Tooling:** Developed a rule engine utility for pin multiplexing validations. Implemented an LLM-powered ticket resolution system leveraging vector search.

- **Modern Frontend Engineering & Reliability:** Revamped the ReactJS UI and performed continuous performance enhancements, ensuring an engaging and robust user experience. Enhanced system reliability using Kubernetes.

- **Here are a few personal project highlights:**
    - **Vehicle Logging & Parking App (ANPR):**  
  Developed a cloud-based parking management system using deep learning, Flask, and Raspberry Pi.

## Photography: A Glimpse Into My Hobby

In my free time, I capture moments and explore the world through my camera. Here are some of my favorite shots:
