## Summary

Manual ticketing and RFID tags slow down parking lots and frustrate users. This project aimed to **automate vehicle entry and exit** by recognizing license plates in real timeâ€”making parking smooth, fast, and hassle-free.

This project brings you an **Automatic License Plate Recognition (LPR) API** built as a Flask microservice, powering a smart parking solution. It combines a YOLOv3 model for plate detection, OpenCV-based character segmentation, a 35-class CNN for character recognition, and Levenshtein distance for reliable string matching. Deployed on Google Cloud Platform and backed by Firebase, it even connects to an Android client on a Raspberry Pi. In trials, it achieved **85% recognition accuracy** on real-world images.

## Architecture

The system follows a microservices approach:

1. **Image Capture (RaspberryÂ Pi + Camera)**: Detects motion, captures frames, and sends them to the LPR API.
2. **LPR Flask Microservice**: Runs the full pipelineâ€”detection, segmentation, recognition, and matchingâ€”exposed via REST endpoints.
3. **Firebase Backend**: Stores users, parking slots, and event logs using cloud functions and NoSQL documents.
4. **Android Client**: Provides user authentication, map-based parking browsing, slot booking, and history viewing.

## LPR API Pipeline

### 1. Plate Detection

- Trained YOLOv3 on ~1,800 images (1,600 train / 200 test).
- Achieved recall of 0.96 at 50% IoU and 0.87 at 75% IoU.

### 2. Character Segmentation

- Explored single-class YOLOv3 for characters.
- Implemented contour detection with pixel projections for robust segmentation.

### 3. Character Recognition

- CNN classifier over 35 merged classes (Aâ€“Z, 0â€“9 with â€˜O/0â€™ combined).
- Trained on ~60,000 images, reaching 95.66% accuracy.

### 4. String Matching

- Applied Levenshtein distance to compare detected strings against registered plates, correcting minor errors.

### 5. Flask Integration

- Encapsulated all modules in `lpr.py`.
- Wrapped with `app.py` to expose HTTP endpoints and deployed on GCP.


## Implementation Details

**Project Structure**:

```bash
lpr-flask-api/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py              # Starts the Flask server
â”œâ”€â”€ lpr.py              # ML pipeline logic
â”œâ”€â”€ request.py          # Sample client for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ test_module.py      # Unit tests for core functions
â”œâ”€â”€ registered_plates.json
â”œâ”€â”€ images/             # Sample input images
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ documentation/      # Diagrams and flowcharts
```

**Prerequisites**:

```bash
pip3 install tensorflow==1.14 opencv-python pillow
sudo apt-get install libsm6 libxrender1 libfontconfig1 libxext6
```

Ensure pretrained model weights are stored in a `WEIGHTS/` directory at the root.

**Running the Service**:

1. Start Flask:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0
   ```
2. Test with a sample image:
   ```bash
   python3 request.py
   ```
3. Standalone LPR script:
   ```bash
   python3 lpr.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

## Results & Evaluation

- **Detection**: 79/98 plates detected at 50% IoU (0.79 recall).
- **Recognition**: 93.67% accuracy over 4,000 test characters, loss = 0.058.
- **End-to-End**: 34/40 plates matched exactly (85% accuracy), ~4.8s per request.

## Future Work

- Expand dataset for improved robustness.
- Experiment with ensemble models for edge cases.
- Build a real-time admin dashboard with analytics.
- Optimize concurrency for high-traffic scenarios.
