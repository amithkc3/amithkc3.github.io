Hi, So here is how I created this site.

1. Clone the repo from `https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter` as `<username>.github.com`
2. Follow this steps mentioned in this wiki [https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/wiki](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/wiki)
3. Make changes to `_config.yml` and modify the `_tabs/about.md` page
4. Add post in the `_posts` folder example this post is from file called `2025-03-21-1st-post.md`
5. Push the changes to github repo
6. Enable the Github build action as mentioned in this here - [https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/#deploy-using-github-actions](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/#deploy-using-github-actions)
7. Whenever a new commit is added the changes are automatically built and deployed to the github pages url
